This repository contains the code for both model and data generation accompanying our paper ["Recurrent convolutional neural networks for non-adiabatic dynamics of quantum-classical systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06631#).

## Abstract

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time- evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their abil- ity to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolutional neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynam- ics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is gov- erned by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolutional (PARC) neural network structure incorpo- rates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. Validation studies show that the trained PARC model could reproduce the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model with comparable accu- racy to direct numerical simulations. We also investigate the scaling of prediction errors with size of training dataset, prediction window, step-size, and model size.
